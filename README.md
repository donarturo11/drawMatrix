# drawMatrix
Command line controlled prototype of painting application. It could be helpful to make ASCII- and ANSI-art.
This application was prototype of drawing system to another application named [uncleMcDonald](https://github.com/donarturo11/uncleMcDonald).

# Usage
Because it is primitive prototype, I didn't write documentation yet.
To see, which commands are possible, go to file TextUI.cpp and find TextUI::runCommand(std::string cmd) under cmd variable.

# Build and run:
Simply type in terminal:
```
make
./drawMatrix
```
This application should be runned under all platforms having C++ compiler.
